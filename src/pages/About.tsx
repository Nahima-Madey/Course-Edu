            and the accountant who's truly a creative at heart.

            <p className="mb-4">
              CourseEdu was born from a simple realization: most people don't know what careers 
              exist beyond the obvious ones. While everyone knows about doctors, lawyers, and teachers, 
              few people know about UX researchers, sustainability consultants, or learning experience designers.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We started this platform because we believe that career confusion often stems from 
              limited exposure to possibilities, not from lack of talent or passion. When you don't 
              know something exists, you can't pursue it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we're building a comprehensive resource that helps curious minds discover 
              their next adventure, whether they're students choosing their first path or 
              professionals ready for a meaningful change.
